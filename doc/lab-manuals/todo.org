*** DONE Testmain1
- needs cooperative thread scheduler without interrupts

  Meaning: create method =OS_Suspend= that, when called, transfers
  control from the current thread to the next waiting thread.

  This will be the sole method of thread switching in this program.

*** DONE Testmain7
I don't think a description of this main program was included in
the lab manual.

*** DONE OS_Launch
*** DONE Context switching
**** init
1. Give =PendSV= handler lowest priority
**** action
1. SysTick interrupt fires
   1. prepare for context switching
   2. pend the =PendSV= exception
      [[./img/pendsv_context_switch.png]]
2. Enter =PendSV=
   1. do context switch
      The exception sequence (that landed you in the =PendSV= handler)
      has saved R0-R3, R12, LR, PC, xPSR. Thus, =PendSV= is only
      responsible for storing R4-R11 to the process stack.

** TODO [1/3] Part 2
Your job is to design, implement and test operating system commands
that implement a multiple thread environment.

Note: The word task in this lab is not a formal term, rather a general
description of an overall function implemented with a combination of
hardware, background threads (ISR), and foreground threads (main
programs).

  - [X] There are four (or more) interrupts in this system DAS, ADC,
     Select, and SysTick (thread switch).
     Justify your choice of hardware priorities in the NVIC?
  - [X] Explain what happens if your stack size is too small.
     How could you detect stack overflow? How could you prevent stack overflow from crashing the OS?
  - [X] Both Consumer and Display have an OS_Kill() at the end. Do these
     OS_Kills always execute, sometime execute, or never execute?
     Explain.
  - [X] The interaction between the producer and consumer is
     deterministic. What does deterministic mean?
    - Assume for this question that if the OS_Fifo has 5 elements data
    is lost, but if it has 6 elements no data is lost.
    - What does this tell you about the timing of the consumer plus display?
  - [X] Without going back and actually measuring it, do you think the
     Consumer ever waits when it calls OS_MailBox_Send?
     Explain.
* [1/1] Lab 3
** DONE [4/4] Preparation
*** DONE Add libjitter
**** DONE Add profiling functionality to os
PendSV needs to record the SysTick before and after thread switch to
determine the amount of thread-time jitter. Maybe have each thread
record these jitter values? Not sure how to library-ize this...
**** Valvano
Add features to the OS to measure and record time jitters for the two
periodic threads. Record two maximum jitters and two histograms of
jitter values. In particular, move the jitter measurements from Lab2
into the OS, and make two copies of it. Feel free to change any of the
user code in Lab2.c so they are compatible with your RTOS.
**** Decrypted
Add libjitter, which just keeps a running average and/or buffer of
pidwork values. Research SV (System Service Call).
*** DONE [4/4] Aperiodic background thread triggered on button press
**** DONE Create priority threads
**** DONE Create single-shot threads
**** DONE Button Detection
**** DONE Button Debouncing
**** Valvano
Write C code to implement the second aperiodic background thread,
triggered by a falling edge on PF0. In hardware this is implemented
with the SW2 button. On the robot, you could add a bumper switch and
use this feature to detect collisions. Your OS should allow the user
to activate and arm this feature by passing a user function to
execute, and using the external event mechanism to trigger the
background task. You should also provide an OS function to disarm this
feature. The priority parameters for OS_AddPeriodicThread
OS_AddSW1Task and OS_AddSW2Task allow the user to specify the relative
priority of the four background threads.
**** Decrypted
Basically, get libhw working and make libbutton generalized to work on
any gpio (it's almost there).
*** CANCELED Implement a counting semaphore
**** Valvano
Consider at least two ways to implement blocking semaphores. In this
class, we have 1 to 10 foreground threads.  How would your
implementation be different if there were 100 foreground threads?
Write C code to implement the blocking semaphores. Take one of the
test programs from Lab2.c and modify it to test the blocking
semaphores. In particular, there should be multiple threads signaling
the same semaphore, and multiple threads waiting on that same
semaphore. You should signal both in the background and in the
foreground, but you can only wait in the foreground. Use counters to
make verify the total number of times signal is called matches the
total number of times wait allows a thread to pass. The key is to run
the system in an exhaustive manner increasing the likelihood of
finding bugs. For example, if there is a 1 in 10 4 chance of Condition
A occurring (e.g., PC is executing at a particular spot) and a 1 in 10
4 chance of Condition B occurring, there will be a 1 in 10 8 chance of
Conditions A and B occurring at the same time. You also have to be
careful not to introduce critical sections in the test program itself.
Edit Lab2.c so it is compatible with your RTOS. Modify the numbers in
Signal2() so that the period of this thread is variable.
**** Decrypted
Make a counting semaphore.
*** DONE Consider how to implement a priority scheduler
**** Valvano
Consider at least two ways to implement the priority scheduler. Again,
think about how would your implementation be different if there were
100 foreground threads? Write C code to implement the priority
scheduler.
**** Decrypted
Think about how to implement a priority scheduler. Then implement it.
