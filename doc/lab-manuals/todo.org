  Use the stdio library and remap the serial stream to the UART. See the
  =retarget.c= file in the =Keil\ARM\Boards\Keil\MCBSTM32\Blinky= project
  included in the Keil installation. In particular, you need to create a
  fputc function like this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    int fputc(int ch, FILE *f){
      UART0_OutChar(ch);
      return (1);
    }
    int fgetc (FILE *f){
      return (UART0_InChar());
    }
    int ferror(FILE *f){
    /* Your implementation of ferror */
      return EOF;
    }
  #+END_SRC
** DONE Checkout
- demonstrate measuring of timer2 ISR overhead
- be prepared to field questions addressing interrupts/FIFOs
- demonstrate each interpreter command
- show screen displaying two stuffs

*** TODO Testmain1
- needs cooperative thread scheduler without interrupts

  Meaning: create method =OS_Suspend= that, when called, transfers
  control from the current thread to the next waiting thread.

  This will be the sole method of thread switching in this program.

- preemptive thread scheduler with SysTick interrupts

  SysTick suspends the running thread and begins the next active
  thread in the list with a round robin fashion.

*** VERIFY Testmain7
I don't think a description of this main program was included in
the lab manual.

*** DONE OS_Launch
*** DONE Context switching
**** init
1. Give =PendSV= handler lowest priority
**** action
1. SysTick interrupt fires
   1. prepare for context switching
   2. pend the =PendSV= exception
      [[./img/pendsv_context_switch.png]]
2. Enter =PendSV=
   1. do context switch
      The exception sequence (that landed you in the =PendSV= handler)
      has saved R0-R3, R12, LR, PC, xPSR. Thus, =PendSV= is only
      responsible for storing R4-R11 to the process stack.
*** TODO Checkout

** [0/5] Part 2
Your job is to design, implement and test operating system commands
that implement a multiple thread environment.

Note: The word task in this lab is not a formal term, rather a general
description of an overall function implemented with a combination of
hardware, background threads (ISR), and foreground threads (main
programs).

Tasks should behave as outlined below

TODO: do we have to calculate jitter on these suckas?

*** TODO Task 1 : Software triggered data acquisition and filtering
What's the AR? I have no idea.
**** notes
For the data acquisition system DAS, the software must start the
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and read the result at precise time
intervals.

In Labs 2 and 3, f_s is 2 kHz.

I don't know what the fuck this page is asking me to do.
*** TODO Task 2 : Aperiodic task triggered by the select switch
A background thread =ButtonPush= should be run whenever the user touches
the select button. This task will create a foreground thread that:

1. outputs to the LCD,
2. sleeps for 50ms,
3. outputs again to the LCD, then
4. kills itself

Note: if the user pushes the button faster than once every two
seconds, multiple foreground threads will exist simultaneously.
*** TODO Task 3 : Hardware triggered data acquisition and FFT
This task will sample the ADC every 400 Hz (2.5 ms) via a
hardware-triggered timer.

1. start collecting data (takes 64 ms)
2. fft on the block, when done trigger interrupt
3. ADC ISR (=producer=) pushes with =OS_Fifo_Put= into global mem space
4. =Consumer= foreground thread calculates the FFT
   question: so the fft is calculated twice? once by us once by
   hardware?

*Note*: you *must* use 16-bit mode for timer-triggered adc sampling.
*** TODO Task 4 : CPU Bound task
*** TODO Task 5
