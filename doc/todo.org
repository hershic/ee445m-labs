*** minimum viable product for lab 3
** [0/4] hardware
*** TODO Absorb HW_TYPE into a common metadata field
*** IN-PROGRESS bi directional notifications
look at ASSERT (ti libs)
*** TODO prevent nonexistent hardware access
[[file:~/workspace/ee445m-labs/lib/libhw/hardware.c::hw_channel*%20_hw_get_channel(HW_TYPE%20type,%20hw_metadata%20metadata)%20{][for example]], hardware.c treats all peripherals as devices containing
the same number of channels. We should have some sort of bounds
checking, even in debug-mode (compile and run the robot through the
maze with extra checks to look for failures, then switch a compile
time flag and run in release mode with minimal checks (due to the
veritability of the code) and mucho speed)
*** TODO check to see if a signal is connected before attempting a disconnect
A successful check could be a bounds check in the while condition to
test for out of bounds indexing. I suggest turning this into a compile
time flag (danger_zone? another one) that can be disabled for extra
speed boosts (keep it as a trick up your sleve until contest day) when
performance is demanded.

** [1/1] SysTick
Systick is currently used to schedule =PendSV_Handler= context switches,
so it cannot be used for anything else. It should not be exposed via
an interface
*** CANCELED Initialization macro
convert this code into a single call that is readable, i.e. you can
immediately tell to what frequency/period the SysTick will interrupt.

** [4/5] OS
*** OPTIONAL Thread addition macro
Create a macro to map over supplied threads and do this sort of
initialization. The only next step is os_launch, which should still be
called separately (comment created <2015-02-17 Tue>).

- place a magic packet in memory at the end of your stack, check for
  changed contents

esc read on <2015-02-23 Mon>:
"Do you have in mind a correctness criterion that can be expressed as
a property you can formalize? Or is your notion of correctness simply
the absence of 'bugs.'"
- how do you verify the os? hypervise that shit
  get another meta level in there, run functions and compare output
  that should be expected from the test
*** TODO create stack watcher
die on attempted overflow
*** TODO reposition the memory
don't shoot yourself in the foot with a lodaed stac
(insert picture here)

There have been multiple issues where gcc doesn't check my code,
instilling false confidence in what is actually running.
